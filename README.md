# matching
Implements the auction algorithm for finding a maximum weight matching in a weighted bipartite graph with non-negative integer weights.
This is about a direct implementation of the sudo code for the auction algorithm at https://agtb.wordpress.com/2009/07/13/auction-algorithm-for-bipartite-matching/. 

This was a collaborative project done with Anna Bachstein in MATH 8160 Network Algorithms and Data Structures, Spring 2019, Prof. Matthew Saltzman.
